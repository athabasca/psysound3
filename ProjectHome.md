PsySound3 is software for the analysis of soundfiles using physical and psychoacoustical algorithms. It is an easy to use platform that does precise analysis using standard acoustical measurements, as well as implementations of psychoacoustical and musical models (such as loudness, sharpness, roughness, pitch, rhythm and running IACC).


The program is written using the Matlab language, and requires Matlab to run. The program is controlled using a Graphical User Interface and should be relatively straightforward for endusers. We have a large emphasis on future extensibility, which is the main reason for writing the program in Matlab. The extensive graphing facilities built into Matlab are also available, as is flat text file, excel file and matlab export.
